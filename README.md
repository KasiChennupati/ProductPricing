# ProductPricing

The product pricing idea has germinated from the previous project i was working on and there is a need the market to build a system for product and contract managers.
As the contract agreement revisions are made after the initial product pricing and billing Business logic is finalized and the business has no option but to create a special pricing plan or offers to the customer to secure the business from the customer this creates a huge problem foe the engineering and operations team to edit the logic for one specific customer as this requires a new story, design, development testing upon testing and deployment. By the time the team completes the process there will be a huge revenue leakage (Over billing the customer or under billing the customer) this results in a drastic CSAT score and the customer will be leaned to opt for a different service provider.

The aim of this system is to act as a management system between the product, inventory, orders, jobs, billing and contract systems.

yes the days of treating the contracts as documents and storing them in the document managent systems just to save them inthe repository are over this system aims to leverage the possibilities of OOPS concepts in the traditional programming methodology and applies the same to the Business Problem.
